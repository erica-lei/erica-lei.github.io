		<div id="about-content"> <p> I'm a senior finishing up my undergraduate career at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Economics. I currently work as a Web Marketing Assistant for the University Development and Alumni Relations at UC Berkeley. </p> <p> I am born and raised in Rosemead, California which is approximately an hour west from Los Angeles. An aspiring musician, baker, and coffee critic, I aim on working in marketing field after I graduate, focusing on either analytics or design. During my off time, I would love to sleep in long road trips, hike forest trails, and search for the next best Poke restaurants. Feel free to talk to me about anything! I would love to talk about current events, movies, punny jokes, political discussions, trending music, world politics, and cheap road trips over a cup of coffee. </p> </div>
